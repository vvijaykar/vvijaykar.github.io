I concurrently completed a certificate in Data Science & Visualization through UCSD Extension and I am deeply interested in the intersection of social impact and technology.

                    <p>At the core of my beliefs are the values of empathy, altruism and curiousity, which have guided me into spaces like <a href="https://medium.com/@CivicWhitaker/what-is-civic-tech-b61a58c3eba8" target="_blank">civic technology</a>,  financial technology</a>, and crypto/web3.

                    <p>I worked on financial innovation research to advance housing affordability in Mexico, I was able to go beyond the scope of the research and actually work along side the Market Systems Development team to analyze <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C-nI7JScLKCTmiPVsqDVww6JsRp7YpABfcO4QQ300ZA/edit#slide=id.p" target="_blank"> case studies</a> for fintech service providers in Mexico City.

                    <h2>When I've Failed</h2>
                    <hr>
                    <p>Alain de Botton's TED Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MtSE4rglxbY" target="_blank">A Kinder, Gentler Philosophy of Success'</a>, discusses the overarching societal ramification of meritocracy, notably the crushing potency of failure. His words eloquently captured an idea that had been churning in my own mind, in a society where those who merit get to the top are praised is the implication that those at the bottom deserve to be there? Often in life, definitions of success and failure are curated by social pressures and not truly our own. The aim of this section is to reframe my own shortcomings and destigmatize the notion of failure, measures of ourselves that aren't always highlighted in a professional or personal matter.</p>

                    <h3>Delta Sigma Pi</a></h3>
                    <p>During the pledging process for Delta Sigma Pi, our class was required to complete a set of tasks in order to demonstrate our willingness and ability to work effectively as a team. During the process though, I definitely overworked myself and burnt myself out which made it even more difficult to accomplish our goals. One apparent example would be when I overbooked myself for our fundraiser and meeting in which I wasn't able to uphold my end of the bargain for both those tasks and ended up late to the fundraiser and disappointing my team. I learned that it was all the more important to be transparent and to delegate to others when necessary in order to build trust, establish personal boundaries, and create a growth-oriented dynamic through accountability.  </p>

                    <p>As a part of my Dimensions of Culture (DOC) requirement at UCSD, I wrote a paper looking at a local community organization and assessing a novel solution to their impact model in the class DOC100D "The Promises and Contradictions of U.S. Culture." The organization that appealed to me the most was <a href="https://benetech.org" target="_blank">Benetech</a>, a Bay-area based non-profit that pioneered software for social good. My paper focused on a critical issue facing nonprofit organizations across the country (grant allocation), and provided a custom solution that not only aligned with the vision and mission of Benetech but also the technological scope of their work. I conceptualized a solution known as Alokate as a grant-matching tool for nonprofits and grant-makers that would increase the transparency in issue areas and automate the process of grant-searching.  </p>

                    <p>The first project I was apart of during my Data Science Bootcamp at UCSD, my team created an interactive jupyter notebook for our class to utilize and showcased a demo of the project (found in the slides above). The premise was simple: where are the best places for data scientists to work and live. As aspiring data scientists/analyst in the course, we found that it would be most effective to center our project on one of the biggest challenges for people making this transition. We included several different datasets pulled from APIs such as Census, Walkscore, and World Weather Online to answer the most pressing questions for data science job seekers to provide a custom, interactive solution to solving where they would reside. </p>

During this process, I was appointed CFO for our "company" and I worked with a team of 4 members to evaluate an income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statement that corresponded with our vision, we developed a marketing/brand strategy, GTM execution plan, and exit opportunties to structure a feasible business model. </p>

                    <h2>What I'm Exploring</h2>

                    <h3>Data-Driven Art 
                        <a href="https://www.ted.com/playlists/201/art_from_data" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-1x fa-link" style="margin-right: 2px;"></i></a>
                    </h3>
                    <p>I've always been fascinated by art, particularly Post-Impressionist and Surrealist works, and as I've explored this interest even more I've fruitfully discovered how technology and art have converged to yield extraordinary works that highlight a brilliant niche. Particularly intrigued by the work of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-EIVlHvHRM" target="_blank">Refik Anadol</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@giorgialupi/dear-data-has-been-acquired-by-moma-but-this-isnt-what-we-are-most-excited-about-bdaa3376d9db" target="_blank"> Giorgia Lupi</a>, and <a href="https://emilysalvador.com/ai_fashion/index.html" target="_blank"> Emily Salvador</a>. Currently experimenting with new projects containing data visualization through vvvv, AR implementation through artivive, and AI x Fashion Design through Nvidia StyleGAN. </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>Historically, fashion has always been a bedrock of cultural exchange, yet often it can be hard to separate the commercialization of cultural exchange from a sense of authentic appreciation. Thus, it is all the more important to actively support and highlight a diverse set of designers from all backgrounds (ethnic, gender identity, sexual orientation) especially as a way of expression and openness in breaking down mainstream ideals of beauty and design.  </a></p>

                    <p>Highly interested in investigating how new technologies such as Blockchain can be used to power new models for change, particularly by decentralizing power, redefining how value is perceived, and ensuring efficiency across transactions. </a></p>
