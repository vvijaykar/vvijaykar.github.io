    <!-- First Paragraph -->
    <p>One of my most intrinsic characteristics is curiosity, I regard it as a fundamental driver in most of my goals. 
       Stumbling upon the intersection between data analytics and finance last summer truly opening my eyes to the burgeoning relationship between the disciplines, one that truly captured my attention. I see the Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp as a strong platform for me to explore this interconnection and allow me to further strengthen my knowledge and skills. I hop to use the classroom environment, network, and career opportunities to truly push myself towards excellence as I strive to cultivate a deep understanding of the field of Data Science and my role within it.

    <p>I am very keen on graduating from this course and putting my utmost effort into this program. I understand that the time and work I put into the program will ultimately yield greater results depending on how hard I’m willing to work. It is in my best interest to not only graduate but also make sure I am constantly improving and reaching higher levels of accomplishment during my time in the program.  '/p' </p>
